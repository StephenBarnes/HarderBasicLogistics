Todos:
- Add exception for burner entities
- Change tooltip for when these rules block things, to sth more like "blocked by nearby inserter"
- Add stackers (eg Deadlock IR3) to the list of stuff that excludes positions.
- Add option for only perpendicular to an inserter - need to hook into the rotation events.
- Add option for only 1 inserter per side of any assembling machine, furnace, etc. - need to hook into the rotation events.

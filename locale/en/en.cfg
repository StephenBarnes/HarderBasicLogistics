[mod-setting-description]
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking=Prevent inserters from being placed next to other inserters. If set to "allow all", no placements will be blocked.
HarderLogistics-remove-long-inserters=If turned on, this mod will remove all long inserters from the tech tree and crafting options. Long inserters already on the map or in inventories will not be removed.
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts=Makes underground belts shorter, and also adjusts their recipes to consume the corresponding number of belt items as ingredients. When it says "shorten to 1" that means there's 1 empty dirt tile between the two underground-belt entities.
HarderLogistics-belt-speed-multiplier=Applies to transport belts, underground belts, and loaders, but not splitters.
HarderLogistics-splitter-speed-multiplier=Set this equal to the belt speed multiplier to make the splitter move at the same speed as the corresponding transport belt. But you could also make them different.

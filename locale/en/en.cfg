[mod-setting-name]
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking=Inserter placement blocking
HarderLogistics-arithmetic-trio-radius=Search radius for trios
HarderLogistics-remove-long-inserters=Remove long inserters
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts=Shorten underground belts
HarderLogistics-reduce-splitter-speeds=Halve splitter speeds

[mod-setting-description]
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking=Prevent inserters from being placed next to other inserters.
HarderLogistics-arithmetic-trio-radius=If inserter placement blocking (above) is set to block arithmetic trios, this is how many tiles far the mod should search for arithmetic trios. Trios bigger than this are not blocked.
HarderLogistics-remove-long-inserters=If turned on, this mod will remove all long inserters from the tech tree and crafting options. Long inserters already on the map or in inventories will not be removed.
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts=Makes underground belts shorter, and adjusts recipes appropriately. When it says "shorten to 1" that means there's 1 empty dirt tile between the two underground-belt entities.
HarderLogistics-reduce-splitter-speeds=Makes splitters have half the speed of the corresponding transport belt.

[string-mod-setting]
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-off=Don't shorten
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-all-1=Shorten all to 1
HarderLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-1-then-increment=Shorten lowest tier to 1, then +1 for each subsequent tier
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-allow-all=Allow adjacent inserters
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-4=Not in 4 directly adjacent tiles
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-8=Not in 8 adjacent tiles
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-cross-5-5=Not in length-2 cross shape
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-arithmetic-trios=Not in arithmetic trios

[string-mod-setting-description]
HarderLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-arithmetic-trios=Blocks any placement that would result in 3 inserters being placed equidistantly in a straight line. See mod page.

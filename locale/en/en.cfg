[mod-setting-description]
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking=Prevent inserters from being placed next to other inserters. If set to "allow all", no placements will be blocked.
HarderBasicLogistics-placement-blocking-burner-inserters=If playing with an extended burner phase, you might need burner inserters to fuel other burner inserters, so you can use this to disable placement restrictions for them.
HarderBasicLogistics-special-machines=Comma-separated list of prototype IDs, for example "ir3-beltbox-steam,ic-containerization-machine-1". If this isn't empty, then special loaders/inserters can only be used with these machines. Note that these machines can still be used with other loaders/inserters.
HarderBasicLogistics-special-loaders-inserters=Comma-separated list of prototype IDs, for example "miniloader-inserter,aai-loader,ir3-loader-steam". If this isn't empty, then these loaders/inserters can only be used with the machines in the setting above. Don't put length-2 loaders in this list, as they have not been tested.
HarderBasicLogistics-remove-long-inserters=If turned on, this mod will remove all crafting recipes for long inserters. Long inserters in inventories or already placed in the world will not be removed.
HarderBasicLogistics-shorten-underground-belts=Makes underground belts shorter, and also adjusts their recipes to consume the corresponding number of belt items as ingredients. When it says "shorten to 1" that means there's 1 empty dirt tile between the two underground-belt entities.
HarderBasicLogistics-belt-speed-multiplier=Applies to transport belts, underground belts, and loaders, but not splitters.
HarderBasicLogistics-splitter-speed-multiplier=Set this equal to the belt speed multiplier to make the splitter move at the same speed as the corresponding transport belt. But you could also make them different.

[string-mod-setting]
HarderBasicLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-off=Don't shorten
HarderBasicLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-all-1=Shorten all to 1
HarderBasicLogistics-shorten-underground-belts-1-then-increment=Shorten lowest tier to 1, then +1 for each subsequent tier
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-allow-all=Allow all
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-4=Not in 4 directly adjacent tiles
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-8=Not in 8 adjacent tiles
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-cross-5-5=Not in 5x5 cross shape
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-distance-2=Not within distance 2 (8 adjacent tiles or 5x5 cross)
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-perpendicular-2=Not in perpendicular 2 tiles
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-perpendicular-4=Not in perpendicular 4 tiles
HarderBasicLogistics-inserter-placement-blocking-block-machine-side=Max 1 on each side of a machine
